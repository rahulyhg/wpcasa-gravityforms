The WPCasa Gravity Forms add-on is a bridge plugin for the Gravity Forms form builder that can be used to display a contact form on single listing pages in WPCasa. The add-on makes sure that useful property information is attached to the emails sent through the form. It also comes with a starter form that includes all the necessary fields to make your life easier. Please find more information at [wpcasa.com](https://wpcasa.com/downloads/wpcasa-gravityforms/).

**Please Notice!** This is an extension plugin and only works in combination with the [WPCasa Real Estate WordPress](https://github.com/wpsight/wpcasa) plugin.
